    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>CNN model to detect driver drowsiness using EEG signals :</b>
        Developed a weighted average emsembled CNN model to detect driver
        drowsiness based on EGG signals using Python libraries like scipy and
        techniques such as SMOTE Analysis, GridsearchCV etc. The model reported
        an accuracy of 95.41%.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Emsembled CNN model for COVID-19 Binary Classification : </b>
        Implemented the concept of CNN on the self- collected data set from
        hospitals in Delhi. Assembled the data from raw stages to final
        structured data. Programmed a novel ensembled CNN model which gives the
        accuracy of 98.54%.
